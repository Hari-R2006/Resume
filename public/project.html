                <h3>Fetus Congenital Heart Disease Diagnostics using ML</h3>
                <p>Currently developing a machine learning–based diagnostic system for early detection of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in fetuses using medical imaging and clinical data. The project aims to enhance prenatal screening accuracy and provide automated diagnostic support in regions with limited access to specialized gynecologists and fetal cardiologists.</p>
